# CI/CD Status

## Current Status
- **No CI/CD pipeline configured yet** (as confirmed by user)
- Local development and testing only at this time

## Future Considerations
When setting up CI/CD, consider:
- GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps pipelines
- Automated testing on PR/commit
- NuGet package publishing automation
- Code coverage reporting
- Performance benchmark tracking

## Manual Workflow Currently Used
1. Local development
2. Manual `dotnet build` and `dotnet test`
3. Manual benchmarking when needed
4. Manual package creation with `dotnet pack`
